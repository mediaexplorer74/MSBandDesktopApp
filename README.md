# MSBandDesktopApp

The official Microsoft Band desktop app, decompiled by [Pdawg](https://github.com/Pdawg-bytes) and "refurnished" by [m][e] :)


## My 2 cents

I tried to refactor the decompiled code. 

My main goal is achieve the state demonstated at screenshots.. oh... mockups! :)


## "Mockups" (the firm app running, not mine, heh!)

![Mockup 1](Images/mockup1.png)
![Mockup 2](Images/mockup2.png)


## My Little Progress

- Microsoft.Band +
- Microsoft.Band.Desktop +
- Microsoft.Band.Admin +
- Microsoft.Band.Admin.Desktop +
- Microsoft.Health.App.Core +
- Microsoft.Health.Cloud.Client +
- MicrosoftBandSyncApp +- (15 %)


## Bugs / Problems

The code structure of MicrosotBandDesktopApp is huge.

Too hard to refactor at my side... but I still plan to recover this great project. ^ ^
