The official Microsoft Band desktop app, decompiled.


## My 2 cents

I tried to refactor the decompiled code. The main goal is achieve the state demonstated at screenshot

## My Little Progress

- Microsoft.Band +
- Microsoft.Band.Desktop +
- Microsoft.Band.Admin +
- Microsoft.Band.Admin.Desktop +
- Microsoft.Health.App.Core +
- Microsoft.Health.Cloud.Client +
- MicrosoftBandSyncApp +- (5 %)


## Bugs / Problems

The code structure of MicrosotBandDesktopApp is huge.

Too hard to refactor at my side... but I still plan to recove this great project. ^ ^
